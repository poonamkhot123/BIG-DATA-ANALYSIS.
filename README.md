**PROJECT DESCRIPTION**

**Objective:**
The objective of this project is to analyze a large dataset of electric vehicles to identify trends, relationships, and insights that can help in understanding pricing, battery capacity, efficiency, and range. The goal is to build a predictive model to estimate vehicle prices based on key attributes.

**Dataset Information:**
- **Name:** Electric Vehicles Dataset
- **Size:** Large CSV file with thousands of records
- **Key Columns:**
  - `model`: Name of the electric vehicle model
  - `manufacturer`: Brand of the vehicle
  - `battery_capacity_kWh`: Battery capacity in kilowatt-hours
  - `range_km`: Estimated driving range in kilometers
  - `efficiency_Wh_km`: Energy consumption per kilometer
  - `price`: Market price of the vehicle in USD
  - `year`: Year of manufacture
  - `charging_time_hr`: Charging time in hours
  
**Questionnaire for Analysis:**
1. What is the relationship between battery capacity and vehicle range?
2. How does efficiency impact the overall price of electric vehicles?
3. Which manufacturers produce the most efficient electric vehicles?
4. Are newer models more efficient and have longer ranges than older ones?
5. What is the correlation between charging time and battery capacity?
6. Can we predict the price of an electric vehicle based on key attributes?

**Conclusion:**
- Electric vehicles with higher battery capacities generally have a longer driving range.
- There is a positive correlation between battery capacity and price, indicating that more powerful batteries increase the cost.
- Efficiency plays a key role in determining how much energy a vehicle consumes per kilometer, affecting operating costs.
- Some manufacturers consistently produce high-efficiency vehicles with better range.
- Machine learning models, such as linear regression, can provide reasonable predictions for electric vehicle prices based on available attributes.

**Insights:**
- Vehicles with better efficiency (lower Wh/km values) tend to have lower running costs.
- Higher battery capacities come with a trade-off in charging time.
- The electric vehicle market is evolving, with newer models becoming more efficient and capable of longer ranges.
- Understanding pricing trends can help consumers make informed decisions when purchasing an electric vehicle.
