**PROJECT DESCRIPTION**

# ⚡Big Data Analysis - Electric Vehicle Population in USA⚡

**Objective:**
The objective of this project is to analyze a large dataset of electric vehicles to identify trends, relationships, and insights that can help in understanding pricing, battery capacity, efficiency, and range. The goal is to build a predictive model to estimate vehicle prices based on key attributes and provide actionable insights for consumers and manufacturers.

**Questionnaire for Analysis:**
1. What is the relationship between battery capacity and vehicle range?
2. How does efficiency impact the overall price of electric vehicles?
3. Which manufacturers produce the most efficient electric vehicles?
4. Are newer models more efficient and have longer ranges than older ones?
5. What is the correlation between charging time and battery capacity?
6. Can we predict the price of an electric vehicle based on key attributes?
7. How does the electric vehicle market evolve over the years?
8. What are the key factors affecting electric vehicle adoption?

**Tools & Technologies Used:**
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Dask
- **Data Processing:** Dask (for handling large CSV files), Pandas (for data manipulation)
- **Visualization:** Seaborn, Matplotlib
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn (Linear Regression model for price prediction)
- **Development Environment:** Google Colab

**Insights:**
- Electric vehicles with higher battery capacities generally have a longer driving range.
- There is a positive correlation between battery capacity and price, indicating that more powerful batteries increase the cost.
- Efficiency plays a key role in determining how much energy a vehicle consumes per kilometer, affecting operating costs.
- Some manufacturers consistently produce high-efficiency vehicles with better range.
- The electric vehicle market is evolving, with newer models showing improvements in range and efficiency.
- Price predictions using machine learning can help in determining fair market values for electric vehicles.
- Charging time and battery capacity show a trade-off: larger batteries take longer to charge but provide better range.

**Conclusion:**
- The electric vehicle industry is rapidly advancing, with significant improvements in battery capacity, range, and efficiency.
- Price is influenced by multiple factors, including battery size, efficiency, and brand reputation.
- Machine learning models can provide valuable predictions for electric vehicle prices, aiding buyers and manufacturers in decision-making.
- Understanding the key attributes of electric vehicles can help in choosing the best model based on efficiency, range, and budget.

**Recommendations:**
- Manufacturers should focus on improving battery efficiency while reducing costs to make EVs more accessible.
- Consumers should consider efficiency and range alongside price when purchasing an electric vehicle.
- Government policies can encourage the adoption of EVs by providing incentives for efficient and affordable models.
- Further studies can be conducted using deep learning models for more accurate price predictions and trend analysis.
